You are an expert technical writer. I want you to create a professional README.md file for my website project. The README should be well-structured, clear, and beginner-friendly. Please include the following sections in detail:

1. Project Title and Description  
   - A clear and attractive title.  
   - A short description of what the website does and its purpose.  

2. Features  
   - List the key features of the website (responsive design, navigation bar, services section, contact form, etc.).  

3. File Structure  
   - Explain the folder and file structure (HTML, CSS, JS, assets, components).  

4. Technologies Used  
   - Mention the technologies and tools (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Google Fonts, Flexbox, Grid, etc.).  

5. Installation and Setup  
   - Step-by-step instructions on how to run the project locally.  
   - Example: clone repository, open index.html in browser.  

6. Usage  
   - How to navigate and use the website.  
   - Mention that images and text can be customized easily.  

7. Screenshots (Optional)  
   - Add placeholder for screenshots of the website.  

8. Contribution Guidelines  
   - Simple rules for contributing to the project (fork, create a branch, submit a pull request).  

9. License  
   - Add a default open-source license section (e.g., MIT License).  

10. Contact Information  
   - Placeholder for developer name, email, and links (GitHub, LinkedIn, etc.).  

Make the README formatted properly with headings, bullet points, and code blocks where required. Use Markdown best practices so it looks clean and professional on GitHub.
